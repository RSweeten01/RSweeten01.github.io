Starting up a GitHub page

1) sign up for a account at https://github.com/

2) once logged in navigate to the add repository (buttons for this can be found all over but the easiest one is a green New button on the upper left side of the home page).

3) a couple of files will need to be added to your new repository. (a .JPG and a .html) any .JPG will do. To do this navigate to the Add file button in your repository and click upload files, You should now be able to drag and drop or choose files to upload from your pc.

3) creating a .html file will be needed to get the personal web page up and running. The following line of code can be used in the html file for the personal web page. 

<html>
    <h1> YourName Portfolio</h1>
    <img src="BioPic.JPG">
    </html>

4) upload your .html file and .JPG to your repository then scroll down and commit your changes. 

Now you should be able to type in your repository name.github.io and see your new personal web page congratulations!
